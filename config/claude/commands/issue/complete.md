```bash
# Create completion archive
mkdir -p .claude/tmp/completed-issues/
cat > .claude/tmp/completed-issues/issue-<issue-number>-complete.md << 'EOF'
# Completed: Issue #<issue-number> - <title>

Completed on: $(date)

## 5. Close the issue

### Close with final comment
```bash
# Close with reference to completion summary
gh issue close <issue-number> --comment "Issue completed successfully. See completion summary above for details.

Thank you to everyone who contributed! ðŸŽ‰"
```

### Close with specific reason
```bash
# If completed as part of a PR
gh issue close <issue-number> --comment "Completed via PR #<pr-number>"

# If completed by sub-issues
gh issue close <issue-number> --comment "All sub-issues have been completed:
- #<sub1> âœ…
- #<sub2> âœ…
- #<sub3> âœ…

Parent issue is now complete."
```

## 6. Update related tracking

### Update parent issues if this was a sub-issue
```bash
gh issue comment <parent-issue-number> --body "Sub-issue #<issue-number> has been completed.

<Brief summary of what was accomplished>

See #<issue-number> for full details."
```

### Update project boards or milestones
```bash
# Remove from active milestone if needed
gh issue edit <issue-number> --milestone ""
```

## Best practices

- Always document outcomes, not just that work is "done"
- Include specific examples and metrics where possible
- Credit contributors with @mentions
- Link to all related PRs, commits, and documentation
- Save learnings for future reference
- Create follow-up issues for any discovered work
- Be thorough but concise in summaries
- Include both technical and user-facing impacts

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature completion
```bash
gh issue comment 789 --body "## Feature Complete: User Authentication System

### Delivered
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Login/logout endpoints with rate limiting
- Password reset flow with email verification
- Session management middleware

### Technical Impact
- Added 3 new API endpoints
- Implemented Redis for session storage
- 98% test coverage on auth module

### User Impact
- Users can now securely log in and maintain sessions
- Password reset reduces support tickets
- Session timeout improves security

### Learnings
- Redis setup was more complex than expected - documented in wiki
- Rate limiting strategy needs monitoring in production
- Consider OAuth integration for future enhancement

### Follow-up
- Created #790 for OAuth integration
- Created #791 for admin user management

This completes the authentication milestone! ðŸš€"

gh issue close 789
```

### Example 2: Bug fix completion
```bash
gh issue comment 456 --body "## Bug Fixed: Data Export Memory Leak

### Root Cause
Memory leak was caused by unclosed file streams in the CSV export module.

### Solution
- Implemented proper stream cleanup in finally blocks
- Added memory monitoring for large exports
- Set maximum chunk size for streaming

### Validation
- Memory usage stays constant even with 1M+ row exports
- Added integration test to prevent regression
- Monitored in staging for 48 hours

### Impact
- Resolves customer complaints about export failures
- Reduces server memory usage by ~60% during exports
- Enables larger data exports

Fixes deployed to production in v2.3.4."

gh issue close 456 --comment "Bug fixed and deployed. Monitoring shows stable memory usage."
```
