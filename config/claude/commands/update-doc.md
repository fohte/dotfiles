# Update or create documentation following project conventions

Update project documentation when making significant changes, discovering patterns, or solving common issues. Focus on practical, actionable information that helps future development.
Note that updates are not necessary if no changes are deemed needed.

# When to document

- After refactoring that changes project structure or patterns
- When discovering non-obvious constraints or gotchas
- After solving errors that others might encounter
- When establishing new conventions or workflows

# Documentation locations and purposes

## CLAUDE.md (Project root)
Project-specific instructions for Claude Code following [Anthropic's best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices).

**Include:**
- Bash commands specific to this project
- Core file locations and purposes
- Code style and naming conventions
- Testing/validation workflows
- Repository etiquette (PR labels, commit conventions)
- Warnings about common gotchas
- Instructions to read directory READMEs

**Avoid:**
- Verbose explanations or tutorials
- Generic best practices
- Information already in README.md
- Details that are obvious from reading the codebase (e.g., what a file extends or imports)
- Implementation details that don't affect daily development

**Example:**
```markdown
# Bash commands

## Build
\`\`\`bash
npm run build  # Build the project
npm test       # Run tests
\`\`\`

# Core files

- `src/`: Source code
- `config/`: Configuration files

# Code style

- Use feature-based file organization
- Name components: `<Feature>.<type>.tsx`

# Testing instructions

- Run unit tests before committing
- Integration tests require env setup

# Warnings

## Common build error
If build fails with X error, check Y first.
```

## Root README.md
Project overview, setup instructions, and general workflows.

**Include:**
- Project description and purpose
- Directory structure overview
- Setup and installation steps
- CI/CD workflows
- General contribution guidelines

# Writing guidelines

- Use bullet points or sections instead of numbered lists
- Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented
- Include code examples with clear Good/Bad patterns
- Focus on "what to do" rather than lengthy explanations
- Add warnings for non-obvious constraints
- Only document behavior that affects development (e.g., "relative imports will error"), not details visible in the codebase
- Test if information is necessary: Would removing it cause someone to make a mistake or get stuck?
